# Translational Immuno-Oncology (Tio Lab) Website

## Overview
This is the official website for the **Translational Immuno-Oncology (Tio) Lab**.

The lab's mission is to unravel the intricate molecular and immunological mechanisms driving cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. By leveraging expertise in immune modulation, viral oncology, and microbial influences, the lab integrates cutting-edge multi-omics data with advanced therapeutic strategies to translate discoveries into innovative diagnostics and targeted therapies.

## Core Research Areas
- **Tumor Immunology:** Dissecting the tumor microenvironment to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.
- **Biomarker Discovery:** Identifying novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis.
- **Cancer Therapeutics:** Developing novel therapeutic strategies and drug combinations.
- **Precision Immunotherapy:** Tailoring approaches based on patient profiles.
- **Tumor Microbiome:** Exploring the microbiome's role in cancer development.

## Site Structure
The website consists of the following main pages:
- **Home (`index.html`):** Overview of the lab, mission, research areas, and funding. Features an interactive p5.js cellular battlefield animation.
- **People (`people.html`):** Information about the lab members.
- **Publications (`publications.html`):** List of research publications.
- **News (`news.html`):** Latest updates and news from the lab.
- **Gallery (`gallery.html`):** Photo gallery of lab events and activities.
- **Contact (`contact.html`):** Contact information.
- **Sitemap (`sitemap.xml`):** XML sitemap for search engine optimization.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structure and styling (`immuno_oncology_theme.css`).
- **JavaScript:** For interactive elements (navbar, accordion, lightbox).
- **p5.js:** For the "Cellular Battlefield" background animation on the homepage.
- **Font Awesome:** For icons.

## How to Run
Since this is a static website, you can simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the site.

## Funding & Collaborations
The lab is supported by:
- Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS)
- Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
- Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
